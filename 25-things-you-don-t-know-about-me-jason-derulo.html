If I was around pets, dairy, or dust, I'd have an asthma attack.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;I played basketball in high school. My high school team was the No. 14 team in the country and won four state titles in Florida.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;I was a ghostwriter in the industry for three years before making it as an artist. I still write songs for other artists today.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;I was BMI's co-songwriter of the year for 2010 alongside <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>, for writing the most top songs in 2010.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;I went to college for musical theater in New York City.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;I'm attracted to polite women, but like bad girls too.</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>My middle name is Joel, which is also the first name of my father and older brother.</p><p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;I'm the youngest of three children, so I was always spoiled a little bit more.</p><p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;When<span>&nbsp;I'm in a relationship, I write songs for and sing to the person I'm with.</span></p><p><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;I kept to myself in school and wasn't interested in going to homecoming, prom, or attending most school social functions. People may have thought I was obsessed with myself, but really, I was obsessed with honing my craft.</p><p><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;I think most celebrities are jerks. Get that chip off your shoulder!</p><p><span><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;</span>I love&nbsp;Olive Garden, especially the Alfredo sauce. But, when I went Italy, they didn't even know what Alfredo sauce was. Shocking!</p><p><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;I wish I knew how to cook. Every dinner attempt has ended in a disaster.</p><p><strong>14.&nbsp;</strong>I fell in love in Australia.</p><p><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;I'm a very sexual person.</p><p><strong>16.&nbsp;</strong>I had a grapefruit tree in my backyard growing up so grapefruit was always an ingredient for every meal. I no longer like grapefruit.</p><p><strong>17.&nbsp;</strong>I've never broken a bone.</p><p><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;I used to eat four bananas per day when I was in college in New York because they were 25 cents a piece and I was a baller on a budget. People would ask why I ate so many bananas and I would say, 'I'm on this new potassium diet.'</p><p><strong>19.</strong> I've given every plaque or award I've won to my mother.</p><p><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;I was chubby for a few years of my childhood and was insecure about taking my shirt off at the pool, so I wore a T-shirt in the pool. Now, I rip my shirt off at every show.</p><p><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;I'm not into drugs, but I love a social drink. My preferred beverage is a Mojito, but I usually drink Vodka and water because it prevents a hangover and is not as bad for the six-pack.</p><p><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;I sleep about four hours per night and I cannot wake myself up. Someone has to wake me up by either banging on my door or physically shaking me.</p><p><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Once I find a meal that like, I'll eat it every day for months. The meal becomes a part of my routine until someone forces me to try something else.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;My father and my mother are still married today. I come from a loving, middle-class family.</p><p><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;I dated my childhood sweetheart all through high school, and thought for sure I would marry her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOa2xmrJieu6i%2FjLKmrmWUpLu1ecqnprBlkZe8tsCMppxmopGovK95w56prqSfYn9xfZBrbnI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angela-rippon-lesbian-sexuality-partner-and-dating-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Angela Rippon Lesbian: Sexuality Partner And Dating History</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./13-incredible-royal-dining-rooms-used-by-the-queen-prince-charles-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>13 incredible royal dining rooms used by the Queen, Prince Charles and more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-the-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-servers-down.html>Are the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 servers down?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-poarch-boyfriend-name-wikipedia-wiki-nose-job-new-song-most-liked-video-tiktok-most-view.html>Bella Poarch Boyfriend Name, Wikipedia, Wiki, Nose job, New Song, Most Liked Video, Tiktok Most View</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chantel-jeffries-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-boyfriend-dating-kids-bio-wiki.html>Chantel Jeffries Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deiby-y-leslie-video-viral-twitter-deiby-ruiz-y-su-novia.html>Deiby Y Leslie Video Viral, TWITTER, Deiby Ruiz Y SU Novia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaavia-james-union-wade-10-facts-on-gabrielle-union-s-daughter.html>Kaavia James Union Wade: 10 Facts on Gabrielle Unions daughter</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ.
