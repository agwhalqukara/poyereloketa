It’s crafted with long-lasting polymer crystals in the vest to absorb water and designed with <b>evaporative cooling </b>to keep your dog cool for up to nine hours. To use, simply soak the vest in water for five minutes before popping on your furry friend.</p><p><b>WHAT REVIEWERS SAY</b></p><p>“What a difference it makes to keep our girl nice and cool on our walks. Big thumbs up! We even tried hanging it on our backs, just to see how it feels, and it really does make a difference,” said one five-star review on Google Reviews.</p><p>Others love how the “vest actually works” and that their dogs are “much more comfortable” since using it.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>FuzzYard Dog Cooling Bandana Summer Punch, $19.11 (down from $19.11) at PetCulture</a></b></p><p><b>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</b></p><p>If your dog doesn’t like the feel of a vest, maybe a cooling bandana might be the trick.

Despite having fur over almost their whole bodies, dogs can still get sunburnt, particularly around their eyes, ears and noses.

One thing that can be annoying to dogs is having their ears covered. These lovely hats have slots to allow your dogs ears to point up,” said one five-star review.

They also double as protective shoes from the mud and rain if you’re over having dirty footmarks all over the carpet. The pack comes with 12 pairs so you have enough to keep your dog safe all summer. Made from 100 per cent biodegradable natural rubber, this is a purchase you won’t regret.</p><p><b>WHAT REVIEWERS SAY</b></p><p>Over 4,600 shoppers on Amazon have given these dog shoes five-stars so you know they are going to be good. One five-star review called these shoes “the best dog booty product on the market”. Others noted how they “don’t come off when walking” and dogs barely seem to “notice” them.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>All for Paws Chill Out Ice Bandana, $24.99 at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</b></p><p>Another great option if your dog struggles with most accessories.

Simply fill the centre section with normal tap water and the pad technology will keep your pet cool all day. Plus, by raising the bed off the ground, more airflow and breathability is ensured.</p><p><b>WHAT REVIEWERS SAY</b></p><p>“It was super easy to assemble and to add in the water. I can tell he’ll be sleeping a lot better now. It feels super sturdy and it’s easy to move around,” said one five-star review. Another happy customer mentioned the durability of the bed saying, “I got one for my dog 12 years ago and it is still in great shape.”</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Coolaroo Original Elevated Dog Bed, $59.99 (down from $69.99) at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW</b></p><p>Crafted from highly breathable fabric, this bed is designed to keep your furry friend cool on warm days.

It also features a handy clip so you can hang the bowl from your dog’s lead, your bag handles or from a belt loop.</p><p><b>WHAT REVIEWERS SAY</b></p><p>“I attach this to the lead using the supplied carabiner when we go for long walks. Our dog (german shepherd) likes to drink out of it, and even though it’s small, there’s enough for her to get a good drink when it’s filled from my water bottle or a tap,” says one five-star reviewer. Another similarly said, “We take this with us on our daily walks and love how compact it is folded down, it holds more than enough water for our small dog.”</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><span class=h2><b>DOG POOLS</b></span></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Yaheetech Foldable Pet Swimming Pool, $69.11 at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</b></p><p>This collapsible pool is a great idea for dogs who love swimming.

She loves it on hot days to cool off. Very good value, durable, and easy to fold away,” said one five-star review. Another wrote: “We bought this pool for our lab puppy, and it’s been a hit. Frankly, I wish we had bought it years ago for our kids, when they were toddlers, instead of the inflatable options that just sat out in the yard, creating dead spots in the grass, impossible to put away.”</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Meowant Foldable Dog Pool, $68.29 at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</b></p><p>Crafted from extra tough 0.5mm PVC and hard plastic boards, this foldable pool is a strong choice.
