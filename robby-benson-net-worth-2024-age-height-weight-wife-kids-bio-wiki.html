His height is 1.78m tall, and his weight is 75 kg.<h2>Career</h2><p>In 1967, he played a minor role in <i>Wait Until Dark</i>&nbsp;thriller before making his debut in Broadway in the <i>Rothschilds</i>&nbsp;musical in 1970. Later on, he made appearances in <i>Happy Days</i>&nbsp;sitcom and <i>Search for Tomorrow soap.</i>&nbsp;In 1977 he starred in <i>One One</i>, a sports drama which he co-wrote with Jerry Segal, his father. In 1978, he was the star in <i>The Death of Richie</i>&nbsp;movie before co-starring in <i>Ice</i>&nbsp;<i>Castles</i>&nbsp;and <i>The End</i></p><p>In 1981, he was co-starring the film <i>The Chosen</i>&nbsp;which got mixed reviews. He has appeared in several movies and TV shows that have gone to do well commercially. Besides acting and directing, Benson is a professor, teaching Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, University of South Carolina, and the University of Utah.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>His career in the film industry hasn’t gone unnoticed with Benson being nominated in several awards, of which some of them he has won. In 1974, he was nominated for Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer in the male category. &nbsp;He has been nominated in several other categories though he is yet to win any award.</p><p>Some of his work has seen some harsh critic with movie critics rating them poorly. Stinker Award has nominated him in several of its awards, winning a total of three. Among stinker awards, he has won Worst Fake Accent twice in Male category and worst song-performance in a film.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Robby Benson in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robby-Benson-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Having a career in the movie industry has seen his fortune rapidly grow, though very slowly. His appearances in television series have also been a source of income. Besides acting, he has also been earning well as a professor in three universities. Currently, Benson is estimated to be worth $3 million as of July 2024.</p><p>Though his career started on high, it got to the point that it stagnated with Benson admitting he is partly to blame. This to him was a lesson he learned the hard way, which today he won’t repeat. In 2003, Benson and his wife bought land in North Carolina, which they relocated their family to in 2007. His wife is still working as an actress while Benson has been more in his education career lately.</p><span class=td-page-meta itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Person></span><span class=td-page-meta itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span class=td-page-meta itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span class=td-page-meta itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZL%2BwrsGyZJudnqi8r3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kWlpaWViZX9yew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-andr%C3%A9-philippe-gagnon-net-worth-2024-wiki-real-name-age-height-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Andr-Philippe Gagnon Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mariska-hargitay-supported-by-husband-peter-hermann-in-major-achievement.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mariska Hargitay supported by husband Peter Hermann in major achievement</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-the-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-servers-down.html>Are the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 servers down?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-poarch-boyfriend-name-wikipedia-wiki-nose-job-new-song-most-liked-video-tiktok-most-view.html>Bella Poarch Boyfriend Name, Wikipedia, Wiki, Nose job, New Song, Most Liked Video, Tiktok Most View</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chantel-jeffries-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-boyfriend-dating-kids-bio-wiki.html>Chantel Jeffries Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deiby-y-leslie-video-viral-twitter-deiby-ruiz-y-su-novia.html>Deiby Y Leslie Video Viral, TWITTER, Deiby Ruiz Y SU Novia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kaavia-james-union-wade-10-facts-on-gabrielle-union-s-daughter.html>Kaavia James Union Wade: 10 Facts on Gabrielle Unions daughter</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ.
