The 26-year-old's mother, <strong>Pebe Sebert</strong>, is speaking out against recent rumors that her daughter is currently getting help for alcoholism.</p><p>"That's a total lie," singer-songerwriter Sebert told <a href=#>Celebuzz</a> on Wednesday, Jan. 8. "The place she's at is an eating disorder center. When they say 'people close to her' I will tell you I travel with her everywhere, her little brother, her assistant, makeup artist, talk to anyone."</p><p>Though Ke$ha's hit songs frequently reference drinking, Sebert insists that her daughter knows her limits when it comes to alcohol. "She might be crazy and she might get shit-faced drunk, but everyone does," she said with a laugh. "She might have a few drinks here and there. But she doesn't have a drinking problem." (Sebert is a recovering alcohol and drug addict, and said Ke$ha has been attending AA meetings with her since she was "just over a year old.")</p><p>The "Timber" singer revealed to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> on Jan. 3 that she was <a href=#>checking into rehab</a>. "I'm a crusader for being yourself and loving yourself, but I've found it hard to practice," Ke$ha said in a statement. "I'll be unavailable for the next 30 days, seeking treatment for my eating disorder . . . to learn to love myself again, exactly as I am."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sebert told Celebuzz that her daughter suffered from body image problems at the age of 18 after signing with Kemosabe Entertainment. "She was dieting and she became bulimic," she revealed. "I remember over a period of a few months she got really skinny and she said she was running Runyon Canyon [in L.A.] and just eating well. The truth is she was throwing up. I didn't know until much later because she said she would quit."</p><p>Ke$ha's mother seems hopeful, however, that treatment will help the "Your Love Is My Drug" singer. "She's doing well," Sebert said. "This is going to be really hard for her. It's been a part of her life for so long." So hard, in fact, that Sebert thinks she may need more than 30 days of treatment. "She may not get out that soon," she said. "That could just be a starting point."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKeq5iWwG65zqZkqZ2Smnq0scGeqa1lna56pa3UoJ%2BtnaKoeq%2B702agp2WimrWiroyfpqtlkaGwsLTOpWSsoJWoeqPBy6KkoptdZ31ygJhq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ufc-logan-paul-confirms-he-offered-to-pay-for-lookalike-s-lawyers-in-nate-diaz-s-lawsuit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>UFC: Logan Paul confirms he offered to pay for lookalike's lawyers in Nate Diaz's lawsuit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-cynthia-bailey-from-rhoa-pregnant-again-age-wiki-bio-everything-on-her-new-husband-mike-hill.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Cynthia Bailey From RHOA Pregnant Again?
